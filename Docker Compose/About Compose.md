- You can build an entire stack for your app with one YAML file and 1 corresponding command to create & run from the file
### Benefits
* Easy to use
* Easy to share
* Fast: caches previous configuration used in older runs, reusing existing containers
* Supports environments
### Usage
* Make your application environment by configuring all of the service dependencies it relies on in that YAML file
	* Interact with it to see how your app behaves
* Automated + Isolated E2E Testing
